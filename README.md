🐱 Image Compression with FFT and Tucker Decomposition

 -This project explores image compression and reconstruction using advanced tensor decomposition techniques. The main goal was to compare two approaches:

 -Spatial Tucker Decomposition

 -"FFT-Tucker" Decomposition (Fast Fourier Transform + Tucker)

🚀 Key Highlights

 -Used memory-saving strategies for contextual image compression.

 -Implemented FFT, Tucker modeling, and GPU-accelerated computing.

 -Dataset: ~900 cat images 🐱.

 -Experimented with UMAP and SOM for automated clustering and dataset cleaning (later done manually due to high similarity of images).

 -Built a GPU passthrough JupyterHub server for experiments.
 
📊 Memory Size Comparison:

 During the project, we tracked how the dataset size evolved through each step of the pipeline.
  
 -Original dataset	~342 MB	Raw images loaded into memory as float64 tensors
 
 -After RFFT (FFT applied)	~173 MB	Real FFT stores only half of the spectrum due to symmetry → reduces memory usage
 
 -After Tucker Decomposition	~3.3 MB	Core tensor + factor matrices (ranks selected), main compression effect
 
📊 Results

 -Achieved 100x image compression.

 -Over 99% reconstruction accuracy.

 -Outperformed comparable methods in all tests.

 -Completed within 3.5 months of research and development.

🔬 Methods

 -Tucker Decomposition: tensor factorization into a core tensor and factor matrices.

 -FFT / RFFT: frequency-domain representation to improve compression efficiency.

 -Mode-n unfolding & n-mode product: key tensor operations for decomposition.

 -Visualization: error maps, PLS analysis, and clustering attempts.

📈 Future Work

 -Explore CP decomposition.

 -Apply methods to larger, real-world datasets.

 -Move towards real-time image compression applications.
